	* linuxtheads/pthread.c (__pthread_initial_thread): Correct
	initializer.
	(__pthread_manager_thread): Likewise.

	Since sigset_t no longer fits in a register, we can't pass in the
	thread's initial mask so easily.  Take this opportunity to simplify
	the clone implementation by only accepting a single void* argument.

	* linuxthreads/manager.c (__pthread_manager): Put thread vitals
	in the thread struct instead of as arguments through clone.
	(pthread_start_thread): Look for them there.
	* linuxthreads/internals.h (struct _pthread): Add p_initial_fn,
	p_initial_fn_arg, p_initial_mask.  Fix __pthread_manager proto.
	* linuxthreads/pthread.c (pthread_initialize_manager): Revise
	clone invocation.
